# PicoCTF - Mod 26

## Problem:
- Cryptography can be easy, do you know what ROT13 is? 
- `cvpbPGS{arkg_gvzr_V'yy_gel_2_ebhaqf_bs_ebg13_nSkgmDJE}`

## Hints:
1. `This can be solved online if you don't want to do it by hand!`
  - Can true, but that ruins the fun! 

## Theory / Plan:
ROT13, as wikipedia describes, is a very simple cipher where the characters are shifted to the by 13 places. [[0]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13)

## Solution:
For this problem, I plan to make a library & binary project, in one.

The main difference is that a library uses lib.rs while a binary uses main.rs.
